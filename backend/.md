## ./middlewares/error.js

1. Custom Error Class (ErrorHandler)

* `class ErrorHandler extends Error:` This line creates a new class called `ErrorHandler` that inherits from the built-in `Error` class. This means `ErrorHandler` objects will have all the properties and methods of the standard `Error` object.

* `constructor(message, statusCode):` The constructor for the ErrorHandler class takes two arguments:

`message:` The error message to be displayed.
`statusCode:` The HTTP status code to be associated with the error.
* `super(message);`: This line calls the `constructor` of the `parent Error class`, passing the `message` to it. This ensures the message property is set correctly on the `ErrorHandler object.`

* `this.statusCode = statusCode;`: This line sets the `statusCode` property on the `ErrorHandler object`, allowing you to associate a specific HTTP status code with the error.

2. Error Middleware Function (`errorMiddleware`)
`text
export function errorMiddleware(err, req, res, next)
: This line exports a function called errorMiddleware that serves as middleware in your Express.js or similar web framework. It's designed to handle errors that occur within your application's routes.`

* `err:` This parameter represents the error object that was thrown.

* `req:` This parameter represents the incoming HTTP request object.

* `res:` This parameter represents the outgoing HTTP response object.

* `next:` This parameter is a function used to call the next middleware in the chain or, if no more middleware exists, to continue processing the request.

text

** `err.message = err.message || "Internal Server Error";`
: This line sets a default error message to "Internal Server Error" if the error object doesn't have a message property already.

** `err.statusCode = err.statusCode || 500;`: This line sets a default status code to 500 (Internal Server Error) if the error object doesn't have a statusCode property.

* `if (err.code === 11000):` This block checks if the error has a code property set to 11000. This is a common error code in MongoDB that indicates a duplicate key violation.

`const message = Duplicate ${Object.keys(err.keyValue)} Entered;`: This line constructs a custom error message specific to duplicate keys, using the name of the field causing the duplicate.
err = new ErrorHandler(message, 400);: This line creates a new ErrorHandler object with the custom message and a status code of 400 (Bad Request).
The remaining if blocks handle other error scenarios:

* `err.name === "JsonWebTokenError"`: This block handles invalid JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), setting a custom message and a status code of 400.
* `err.name === "TokenExpiredError"`: This block handles expired JWTs, setting a custom message and a status code of 400.
* `err.name === "CastError"`: This block handles errors related to type casting (e.g., trying to convert a string to a number incorrectly), setting a custom message and a status code of 400.

3. text

`const errorMessage = err.errors ? Object.values(err.errors).map((error) => error.message).join(" "):err.message;`

Purpose: This line builds the error message that will be sent to the user. It aims to make the error message more informative and user-friendly.

Explanation:

* `err.errors:` This checks if the error object (err) has a property called errors. This property often exists when there are validation errors (e.g., when someone tries to submit a form with incorrect data).

* `Object.values(err.errors):` If err.errors exists, this takes all the values from that object (which are likely individual error objects).

* `.map((error) => error.message):` It goes through each individual error object and extracts the message property from it. This creates a new array containing just the error messages.

* `.join(" "):` This joins all the extracted error messages into a single string, separated by spaces.

* `err.message:` If err.errors doesn't exist, it simply uses the main err.message property of the error object.

`In Simple Terms: This line checks if the error is a validation error with multiple errors. If it is, it extracts all the error messages and combines them into a single, readable message. Otherwise, it uses the main error message.`

4. text

`return res.status(err.statusCode).json({ success: false, message: errorMessage });`

Purpose: This line sends a JSON response back to the user, telling them about the error.

Explanation:

* `res.status(err.statusCode):` This sets the HTTP status code for the response. The err.statusCode property, which was set in the ErrorHandler object, determines the status code (e.g., 400 for "Bad Request," 500 for "Internal Server Error").

* `.json({ success: false, message: errorMessage }):` This sends a JSON object as the response body:

success: false: Indicates that there was an error.
message: errorMessage: The error message constructed in the previous line.
`In Simple Terms: This line sends a response to the user, indicating that there was an error, setting the appropriate status code, and providing a clear error message.`

Example:

Let's say you have a validation error where the user entered an invalid email address and a password that is too short. The err.errors might look like this:

javascript

{
  "email": {
    "message": "Please enter a valid email address",
    "path": "email",
    "value": "invalid_email"
  },
  "password": {
    "message": "Password must be at least 8 characters long",
    "path": "password",
    "value": "short_password"
  }
}
The code would extract the messages from err.errors:

# javascript

`"Please enter a valid email address Password must be at least 8 characters long"
And then send a JSON response like this:

json

{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Please enter a valid email address Password must be at least 8 characters long"
} `
